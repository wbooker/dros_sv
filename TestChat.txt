2/9/21, 12:54 AM - Shorty: and ltc and doge are better vessels as currency than bitcoin
2/9/21, 12:54 AM - Dylbro: I guess because no one uses it
2/9/21, 12:54 AM - Knort The Tort: it is literally the best from software content
2/9/21, 12:54 AM - Shorty: so is doge, they run on the same platform

2/9/21, 12:55 AM - Milo Williams: We in the midst of big fat btc bubble
2/9/21, 12:56 AM - Milo Williams: Though the trend is upwards longterm

2/9/21, 10:49 AM - Knort The Tort: I've only beaten 1 and 3 a few times
2/9/21, 10:51 AM - Knort The Tort: I‚Äôm about to pull back the curtain and tell you what you saw tonight on the Super Bowl half time show. 
In 2008 I was watching the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. There were hundreds of dancers dressed exactly alike, making the exact same movements, in perfect timing. No one stood out. Everyone looked and danced exactly the same.
As I was watching, the Spirit of God spoke to me clearly. And I will never forget the moment! He said, ‚ÄúTHAT IS GOG‚Äù! I knew God spoke to me but I had no idea what he meant. So I started my journey to find out what GOG is and tonight I am going to briefly explain it to you. 
In Ezekiel 38:2 GOG is the Chief Prince of the land of Magog who leads the final invasion against Israel. I can prove in many ways that this is an Old Testament reference to Armageddon. The term ‚ÄúChief Prince‚Äù only appears twice in the Bible. Once in reference Michael, the Chief Prince (Daniel 12:1) and once in reference to GOG in Ezekiel 38:2. 
Long story short, GOG is a demonic principality with an ideology finding its launching place in the land of  Magog or the former Soviet Union. It is the Demon behind collectivism. Collectivism puts the group or the State over the individual. Individualism is what America was built on. Collectivism is what Communist countries are built on. This Demonic spirit of Communism has now infected the entire world and its primary spreader is China. The ideals of collectivist/communist China is GOG! It will eventually dominate the entire world. How do I know this? Because God calls the nations in the four corners of the earth ‚ÄúGOG and MAGOG‚Äù in Revelation 20:8. 
What you saw tonight during the half time show was the demonic principality GOG in America. It is the driving spirit that works with the spirit of Antichrist to deceive the people of the world into becoming one. United as ONE against Christianity and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
This demon believes it now has total control of the United States. I believe he is wrong! Because I believe the United States is the sanctuary for believers in the last days before Christ return. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe wilderness‚Äù in Revelation 12:6 and 14. The Dragon/Satan is using GOG to devour America before it can become what God intends. He will lose this fight. (Revelation 12:13-17) 
What I have written tonight is some of the deepest revelation into End Time prophesy you will ever read. But I have seen these truths and I cannot be shaken from them. America will remain the sanctuary for believers in Christ and it will be the launching pad to the four corners of the earth to reach the greatest harvest of souls in the history of the world. It was dedicated in 1607 by pastor Robert Hunt to do just that. (See also Mathew 24:14, Mathew 13:39, Revelation 7:9 and 14). It is my strong conviction  that GOG is about to lose his grip on America. God is getting ready to shake things up. The world will be shocked by what is about to happen! God‚Äôs harvest is coming! And judgement is coming on those who have set themselves against God‚Äôs natural order.

2/10/21, 5:17 PM - Dylbro: "Men in tactical gear with baseball bats and trump flags searching for the senate chamber isn't an insurrection. Things just got out of hand. President is not guilty"
2/10/21, 5:17 PM - Jackson Yoder: How do you even possibly argue against this? I mean, I know you just lie and gaslight the country but I mean what specific lie tactic do they take

2/10/21, 5:34 PM - Peet: Why is this a big deal?
2/10/21, 5:34 PM - Jackson Yoder: Extremely unhinged boomer behavior
2/10/21, 5:34 PM - Auto: Did we somehow go back to the 70s when smashing a guitar was shocking?
2/10/21, 5:34 PM - Peet: So many people have smashed guitars
2/10/21, 5:34 PM - Auto: Ya fr
2/10/21, 5:34 PM - Jackson Yoder: Boomers gonna boomer
2/10/21, 5:34 PM - Auto: I guess, doesn't seem like it's just boomers tho
2/10/21, 5:35 PM - Jackson Yoder: Boomer is a state of mind
2/10/21, 5:35 PM - Auto: Dad just thought it was kinda weak, I was like dude she is the tiniest person
2/10/21, 5:35 PM - Dally Dally: Evidently Crosby has always thought it was lame,

2/10/21, 5:55 PM - Knort The Tort: its not a good strategy to insult or chastise someone using the thing that offends you, you gotta figure out what offends them
2/10/21, 5:57 PM - Cosnik: It's a tough fucking guitar apparently, she hit up the makers before
2/10/21, 5:58 PM - Knort The Tort: you could say youtube moderator is a casual gamer or a normie and that would probably do it

2/10/21, 6:08 PM - Knort The Tort: but it was her DANELECTRO

2/10/21, 8:13 PM - Dally Dally: I‚Äôll get started on that after work

2/10/21, 8:14 PM - Knort The Tort: <Media omitted>

2/10/21, 8:16 PM - Listeria Jones: It‚Äôs surprisingly complex
2/10/21, 8:17 PM - Listeria Jones: Like what diety(?) do I serve or something
2/10/21, 8:17 PM - Jackson Yoder: Wait until the plains.....
2/10/21, 8:18 PM - Knort The Tort: Molag Bal probably
2/10/21, 8:18 PM - Jackson Yoder: Yes, what time of demonic entity you get your powers from
2/10/21, 8:18 PM - Thommy Boy: I spoke to his wife recently. He just moved out of a halfway house and into his own apartment. He‚Äôs working at a FedEx store and going to meetings regularly.
2/10/21, 8:18 PM - Dally Dally: Yeah, to an extent
2/10/21, 8:18 PM - Jackson Yoder: Which, game wise, manifests as different abilities
2/10/21, 8:18 PM - Knort The Tort: 4:20
2/10/21, 8:18 PM - Jackson Yoder: Type of fuck you!
2/10/21, 8:18 PM - Listeria Jones: Dark queen fae of the underworld or something like that
2/10/21, 8:19 PM - Thommy Boy: Wizardwise deity doesn‚Äôt matter as much
2/10/21, 8:19 PM - Thommy Boy: At least not for summoning
2/10/21, 8:19 PM - Bennie: What pact did you take lirissa
2/10/21, 8:19 PM - Jackson Yoder: Yes, a source of a wizards power is studying books
2/10/21, 8:19 PM - Jackson Yoder: Like a fucking nerd ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
2/10/21, 8:19 PM - Thommy Boy: ü§¨
2/10/21, 8:19 PM - Thommy Boy: What are we even talking about?
2/10/21, 8:19 PM - Knort The Tort: wizards are fucking virgins
2/10/21, 8:20 PM - Thommy Boy: TELL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!
2/10/21, 8:20 PM - Listeria Jones: I‚Äôm a 6‚Äô2‚Äù half elf warlock named sandwich
2/10/21, 8:20 PM - Jackson Yoder: Imagine getting your powers from a book and not from making a pact with a demon possessed sword you found in a ruin
2/10/21, 8:20 PM - Thommy Boy: Well, my wizard doesn‚Äôt know where his powers came from
2/10/21, 8:20 PM - Listeria Jones: I joined a dnd game
2/10/21, 8:20 PM - Thommy Boy: He lost his memory, you see
2/10/21, 8:20 PM - Listeria Jones: Also she‚Äôs hot as fuck
2/10/21, 8:20 PM - Bennie: Imagine not being a disruption in the weave and being able to harness wild magical energy
2/10/21, 8:21 PM - Listeria Jones: And my horse is named meatball
2/10/21, 8:21 PM - Thommy Boy: Sorcerers are gay
2/10/21, 8:21 PM - Bennie: False
2/10/21, 8:21 PM - Dally Dally: Nice
2/10/21, 8:22 PM - Dally Dally: I‚Äôm a dwarf, and I own no horse
2/10/21, 8:22 PM - Thommy Boy: What‚Äôs the effective difference between sorcerer and wizard?
2/10/21, 8:22 PM - Thommy Boy: Besides spellbook
2/10/21, 8:22 PM - Listeria Jones: Wizard can use more spells but has to choose them ahead of time right
2/10/21, 8:23 PM - Peet: I‚Äôm gonna out in my two weeks
2/10/21, 8:23 PM - Thommy Boy: That‚Äôs the spellbook aspect
2/10/21, 8:23 PM - Bennie: As long as they‚Äôre in your spell book
2/10/21, 8:23 PM - Bennie: Clerics have to prepare their spells beforehand
2/10/21, 8:23 PM - Listeria Jones: Ok well I apologize for being a stupid idiot
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Jackson Yoder: Wizards also just have access to waaaay more spells
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Dally Dally: üï∫üèº
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Dylbro: WOW, take it to dnd chat!
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Jackson Yoder: Sorcerer subclasses allow some cool abilities based on the source of your magic
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Listeria Jones: No
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Bennie: And they got a lot of spell slots too
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Dally Dally: Lirissa isn‚Äôt in dnd chat so no
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Bennie: True
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Bennie: But they‚Äôre gimped
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Bennie: Can‚Äôt switch speeds
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Jackson Yoder: Since a sorcerers magic is inherent rather than learned
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Bennie: Spells
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Bennie: I love my sorcerer tho
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Dylbro: Never speak to me directly again
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Bennie: Aberrant mind sorcerer is bad ass
2/10/21, 8:24 PM - Peet: I‚Äôm a halfling rogue named Olly Tealeaf
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Milo Williams: Powerful

2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Milo Williams: Or perhaps Merry
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Peet: No, I‚Äôm chaotic evil
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Listeria Jones: Pippin ü•∫
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Milo Williams: Like i said
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Dally Dally: Is this your 3.5 character or  5e character
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Listeria Jones: I‚Äôm a chaotic neutral
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Thommy Boy: I‚Äôm a human wizard named Virgil
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Peet: 3.5
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Jackson Yoder: Very sick
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Thommy Boy: I am chaotic good
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Peet: We haven‚Äôt cracked 5
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Milo Williams: Nice
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Jojo Scully Boy: I‚Äôm glad Deshaun is doing well
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Knort The Tort: i'm chaotic gay
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Milo Williams: I'm in a party with fuckin good nerds
2/10/21, 8:25 PM - Listeria Jones: We know
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Dally Dally: Older sorcerers should get class specific spells like the new ones
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Milo Williams: It's the worst
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Thommy Boy: Thanks, Joey. I‚Äôll tell him you asked.
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Bennie: I‚Äôm playing a chaotic evil Cthulhu cleric rn
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Dally Dally: imo
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Peet: I‚Äôm gayotic good
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Jackson Yoder: My hot take is that alignments aren't that important üòéüòéüòéüòé
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Milo Williams: True
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Knort The Tort: your character gets buffed the more of a voice you put on
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Listeria Jones: There‚Äôs 3 true neutrals in my group
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Jackson Yoder: And should be derived from other character traits not the other way around
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Milo Williams: Damn do u guys do anything
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Milo Williams: Or just sit around and blaze
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Listeria Jones: Yesterday was the first day!!!!
2/10/21, 8:26 PM - Jackson Yoder: Trying to play to an alignment is v limiting role playing wise and doesn't encourage character development
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Bennie: True
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Knort The Tort: it seems weird that you choose your characters alignment and don't just play how you feel your character should behave
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Jackson Yoder: Right, yeah
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Knort The Tort: yeah that
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Listeria Jones: I bought corn on the cob at the farmers market and then ate it raw
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Dally Dally: U love us
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Bennie: How many people do you play with lirissa
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Milo Williams: Did u kill anything
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Peet: Neutral evil
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Knort The Tort: reminds me of one of the shittiest teachers i ever had that told us to write everything based on a character key
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Milo Williams: Where is your crew in the world
2/10/21, 8:27 PM - Jackson Yoder: I was watching a video about the origins of Dnd alignment and like, chaos vs lawful was actually more about religious differences originally
2/10/21, 8:28 PM - Jackson Yoder: And then became this other thing but ultimately never really evolved enough to match the more RP centric nature of modern ttrpg playing
2/10/21, 8:28 PM - Jackson Yoder: Old Dnd was more of a war game with wizards
2/10/21, 8:28 PM - Peet: Like chaos and divine in souls
2/10/21, 8:28 PM - Listeria Jones: Including me there‚Äôs 6 of us
2/10/21, 8:29 PM - Listeria Jones: So cal, nor cal, and Tokyo

2/10/21, 8:30 PM - Listeria Jones: He‚Äôs my cousin
2/10/21, 8:30 PM - Bard: <Media omitted>
2/10/21, 8:30 PM - Milo Williams: Sounds Asian

2/10/21, 8:30 PM - Listeria Jones: Uhhhh I don‚Äôt remember

2/10/21, 8:31 PM - Dally Dally: Similar, I assume?
2/10/21, 8:31 PM - Thommy Boy: Agree
2/10/21, 8:31 PM - Jackson Yoder: Ish yeah. They come from the same scene, like play together a bunch at this club in Bristol
2/10/21, 8:32 PM - Jackson Yoder: Black Midi is more straight up aggressive and almost math rocky
2/10/21, 8:32 PM - Jackson Yoder: But still extremely fucking British and weird
2/10/21, 8:32 PM - Milo Williams: I think it's bipoc midi these days
2/10/21, 8:32 PM - Listeria Jones: Name something

2/10/21, 8:40 PM - Dylbro: Ok I'll retire from souls games and play Control
2/10/21, 8:40 PM - Knort The Tort: what a dumb idea
2/10/21, 8:40 PM - Thommy Boy: And collect every piece of documentation you can find lying around.
2/10/21, 8:40 PM - Thommy Boy: The best part about the game is learning about the world by exploring as much as possible and picking up the different communications you find lying around the world
2/10/21, 8:40 PM - Milo Williams: But the dlc...
2/10/21, 8:40 PM - Dally Dally: Hitman 3 as well
2/10/21, 8:40 PM - Thommy Boy: There are tons of secret areas
2/10/21, 8:40 PM - Dally Dally: Weirdly

2/10/21, 8:41 PM - Milo Williams: So far my favorite part is being lost as absolute fuck
2/10/21, 8:41 PM - Knort The Tort: bloodborne is the best game ever made next to tomb raider 2 and bugsnax
2/10/21, 8:41 PM - Dylbro: If it's so good why didn't they include it in the original game??
2/10/21, 8:41 PM - Milo Williams: I have no idea what's going on
2/10/21, 8:41 PM - Thommy Boy: You get used to it
2/10/21, 8:41 PM - Milo Williams: ü§î
2/10/21, 8:42 PM - Thommy Boy: The more you play it, the more you understand the world and all that. It‚Äôs meant to be kind of confusinf.
2/10/21, 8:42 PM - Dally Dally: I am genuinely enjoying my time with Bugsnax
2/10/21, 8:42 PM - Dylbro: I might really try to hold out for a bloodborne remaster
2/10/21, 8:42 PM - Dylbro: It looks like ass from what I've seen
2/10/21, 8:42 PM - Thommy Boy: Bloodborne is awful. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
2/10/21, 8:42 PM - Dally Dally: Or at the very least 60fps

2/10/21, 8:42 PM - Knort The Tort: theres a 60fps mod
2/10/21, 8:43 PM - Jojo Scully Boy: Jailbreak my ass
2/10/21, 8:43 PM - Dylbro: Demon's remastered was ü•µü•µü•µ
2/10/21, 8:43 PM - Milo Williams: Sekiro is their latest game tho...
2/10/21, 8:43 PM - Dally Dally: I‚Äôve laughed a lot at some of the collectibles. And the stuff on the poster boards
2/10/21, 8:43 PM - Dylbro: Visually anyway
2/10/21, 8:43 PM - Milo Williams: And will fuck your ass...
2/10/21, 8:43 PM - Dylbro: I've been in an ass fucking bonanza since November
2/10/21, 8:44 PM - Dylbro: Demon's ds2 ds3
2/10/21, 8:44 PM - Knort The Tort: the problems with bloodbornes 30fps is a bit overblown
2/10/21, 8:44 PM - Knort The Tort: ds2 plays at 60 and feels worse
2/10/21, 8:44 PM - Dally Dally: I‚Äôve played only a couple hours of 2 and I think I hate it
2/10/21, 8:44 PM - Jackson Yoder: Gotta follow the signs dog
2/10/21, 8:44 PM - Dylbro: I'm honestly more tempted to play ds1 remastered on ps5
2/10/21, 8:44 PM - Dylbro: It looks.... A looooot better than it did ok switch
2/10/21, 8:44 PM - Dylbro: On
2/10/21, 8:45 PM - Milo Williams: Or perhaps... A horizon....
2/10/21, 8:45 PM - Bennie: It‚Äôs a great game
2/10/21, 8:45 PM - Milo Williams: Or a Shadow of the Colossus...
2/10/21, 8:45 PM - Knort The Tort: horizon is a very chill game
2/10/21, 8:46 PM - Dylbro: What's that?
2/10/21, 8:46 PM - Dylbro: ?
2/10/21, 8:46 PM - Knort The Tort: really good combat in that as well
2/10/21, 8:46 PM - Thommy Boy: Yea, the office humor interspersed throughout is *chef‚Äôs kiss*
2/10/21, 8:46 PM - Jackson Yoder: Play shadow and control before horizon
2/10/21, 8:46 PM - Jackson Yoder: Well, control then shadow
2/10/21, 8:46 PM - Jackson Yoder: Horizon doesn't have a ps5 patch yet
2/10/21, 8:46 PM - Bennie: Shadows mega chill
2/10/21, 8:47 PM - Knort The Tort: horizon is designed like the witcher 3 except instead of focusing on writing a million sidequests they focused on making an actual fun game to play
2/10/21, 8:47 PM - Dylbro: Would it be a hot take to say demon's was my favorite of dark souls games
2/10/21, 8:47 PM - Dally Dally: <Media omitted>
2/10/21, 8:47 PM - Jojo Scully Boy: Horizon looks like poopy Doo Doo
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Bennie: Combats fun in horizon
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Milo Williams: P hot ya
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Bennie: My hot take is that bloodborne is the best souls game
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Dylbro: Alright, that's gonna be my take then
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Milo Williams: That's no one's favorite except hipsters tbh
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Milo Williams: <Media omitted>
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Knort The Tort: played the remake tho, not the original
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Dylbro: I said dark souls
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Knort The Tort: lots of quality of life updates
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Bennie: I know what you said
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Bennie: Dark souls 3 is basically bloodborne
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Milo Williams: Yes
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Milo Williams: But still a basic ass game
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Milo Williams: Relatively speaking
2/10/21, 8:49 PM - Knort The Tort: yeah
2/10/21, 8:50 PM - Dylbro: I really enjoyed the levels on it
2/10/21, 8:50 PM - Knort The Tort: i like the areas
2/10/21, 8:50 PM - Dylbro: Same
2/10/21, 8:50 PM - Milo Williams: Level design is dope
2/10/21, 8:50 PM - Dylbro: It had some real dumb bosses
2/10/21, 8:50 PM - Milo Williams: The boss and combat are just so medio compared yo what was to come
2/10/21, 8:50 PM - Knort The Tort: i cant help but compare boletaria palace to sen's fortress
2/10/21, 8:50 PM - Dylbro: I didn't get creative at all with my build so I dono about that aspect
2/10/21, 8:51 PM - Auto: Hey it's my awesome senator
2/10/21, 8:51 PM - Knort The Tort: because in a sense they are a bit similar
2/10/21, 8:51 PM - Knort The Tort: and boletaria palace is way more detailed
2/10/21, 8:51 PM - Milo Williams: Did u guys see that one senator not call Bernie Sanders an ignorant slut
2/10/21, 8:51 PM - Knort The Tort: i did see that
2/10/21, 8:52 PM - Knort The Tort: it makes sense that the demons souls areas are more fleshed out though, they aren't all connected
2/10/21, 8:52 PM - Milo Williams: https://twitter.com/hjessy_/status/1359546879197986818?s=1002
2/10/21, 8:53 PM - Dylbro: Yeah and the runs are really straight forward
2/10/21, 8:53 PM - Dylbro: For the most part

2/10/21, 8:54 PM - Bennie: Best demon souls boss is king allant
2/10/21, 8:54 PM - Knort The Tort: Truly quantity over quality
2/10/21, 8:54 PM - Bennie: I love his aoe shart attack
2/10/21, 8:54 PM - Bennie: It makes me laugh
2/10/21, 8:54 PM - Dylbro: He was a cool one
2/10/21, 8:55 PM - Dylbro: I wish they'd do dlc for demon's
2/10/21, 8:55 PM - Dylbro: It's very short
2/10/21, 8:55 PM - Bennie: Yea ds2 is bloated as fuck
2/10/21, 8:56 PM - Dally Dally: There were always rumors about whether or not they‚Äôd restore the sixth archstone
2/10/21, 8:56 PM - Dally Dally: Which currently I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre firmly like ‚Äúnah‚Äù
2/10/21, 8:56 PM - Dylbro: Lame!

2/11/21, 2:04 AM - Dylbro: And then there's path of pain which is just completely absurd
2/11/21, 2:08 AM - Cosnik: I'm incredibly scared about what they'll do in the sequel

2/11/21, 2:33 AM - Peet: But yeah I‚Äôm so excited for them to push the wild souls platforming hybrid to it‚Äôs limit
2/11/21, 2:34 AM - Peet: I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve all rallied behind a game so hard since idk
2/11/21, 2:34 AM - Peet: Something that was disappointing
2/11/21, 2:35 AM - Peet: I‚Äôm glad we all played Hades though
2/11/21, 2:38 AM - Dylbro: And I'm still the only one who took down NKG

2/11/21, 9:28 AM - Thommy Boy: He told me that I am not allowed to leave the house without his permission.

I will only work when he says I can work.

He has stopped me from seeing my family.

My friends are banned from the house and there's no way he is allowing me to visit them.

When I am out in public, he makes sure nobody can see my face.

I am only allowed out of the house to bring essential supplies to the household.

Apart from that I am not allowed to go anywhere.... Oh... Except exercise. He doesn't want me getting fat and unhealthy, but I can't exercise with other people, and he won't let me stray too far from our home. 

He said he is going to make me download an app on my smartphone that tracks where I am at all times and reports on the people I am near.

If I complain about any of this he will gaslight me, make it all seem as though it is my fault so I can stay under his control.

Sometimes he will change the rules and only drop hints that the rules have changed so he can catch me out, punish me and make me feel bad, reckless and stupid. 

It's only because he is looking after me you see. It's because he loves me and wants to keep me "safe".

Have any of you ever been controlled like this?

(Now replace HE with "the government") ü§î

2/11/21, 1:05 PM - Jackson Yoder: Was an absolute fucking mess
2/11/21, 1:06 PM - Jackson Yoder: I think they also did a very bad job with a lot of Danys story
2/11/21, 1:07 PM - Jackson Yoder: Oberyn was great buy that's almost entirely because of Pedro's performance
2/11/21, 1:07 PM - Milo Williams: Like that time they had drogo rape her instead of asking for consent then still had her fall in love with him
2/11/21, 1:07 PM - Knort The Tort: It was pretty clear they put most of their focus on the civil war aspect of it
2/11/21, 1:07 PM - Milo Williams: Nah man that's the same character
2/11/21, 1:07 PM - Jackson Yoder: Yes

2/11/21, 1:09 PM - Dylbro: I can't believe Disney cancelled that medio actor from that medio star wars show for being a Patriot
2/11/21, 1:09 PM - Knort The Tort: And that became more obvious when their book material ran out
2/11/21, 1:09 PM - Jackson Yoder: It's just pretty clear to me they're good at adapting stuff that is straight forward and do not care about deeper meaning and seek tk streamline, which is fine enough for GOT in some cases
2/11/21, 1:09 PM - Milo Williams: True but they were fuckin shit up before then
2/11/21, 1:09 PM - Jackson Yoder: But like I cannot imagine them dealing with the absurd complexity of Three Body Problem
2/11/21, 1:09 PM - Jackson Yoder: Which I guess they're stikl doing at some point
2/11/21, 1:09 PM - Knort The Tort: They fucked up Stannis obviously

2/11/21, 1:11 PM - Milo Williams: Ben Shapiro?
